## Variables

### Let 
There are several different ways to define variables, the most common of which today is let. We start by giving it a name, which will normally be in camelcase, then assign a value to it.<br />
```
let luckyNum = 23;
```
 It's a dynamically typed language, which means no data type annotations are necessary. In this case, we've assigned a number, which is one of the seven primitive data types built into the language. However, we don't need to assign the variable a value right now because it can be reassigned later. Without an assignment, it automatically uses the primitive value of undefined as its default value. However, we can explicitly represent an empty value using null, and later on, we could reassign that same variable to a string. It's an entirely different data type, but that's perfectly okay.<br />
## Seven Primitive Data Types
* String
* number
* bigint
* boolean
* undefined
* symbol
* null

Now, any value that's not a primitive will inherit from the object class, but more on that later. Right now, we need to talk about the semicolon. Technically, semicolons are optional because if you leave them out, the JavaScript parser will add them automatically. In real life, JavaScript developers will often fight to the death over whether or not to use semicolons.<br />
```luckyNum = new Object()```
But let is not the only way to define a variable. Another common option is const, which is used for variables that cannot be reassigned later. But the original way to declare a variable is VAR. I would recommend ignoring its existence altogether, although you will find it out in the wild.<br />
```
const name 

```
## Lexical Environment
The reason we have so many different ways to define variables has to do with the lexical environment, which determines where variables work and where they don't. There's a global scope, which is where we are right now, which means this variable will be available everywhere. However, if we define a variable inside a function, it then becomes local<br />
```
let a = 'global'; // Global Scope

function fun(){
    let a = 'function'; // Local Scope

    if (true) {
        let a = 'block';
    }
}
```

In JavaScript, the concept of scope determines where variables can be accessed and used. There are two main types of scope: global and local. The global scope is where we are right now, and **any variable defined in the global scope is accessible everywhere in the program.**
<br />
However, if we define a variable inside a function, it becomes local to that function and cannot be accessed outside of it. If we have a statement like an if condition, variables can be scoped inside the braces or block, unless we use the VAR keyword for that variable. If VAR is used, the variable is hoisted up into the local scope for that function, which can lead to weirdness in the program.
<br />
When it comes to scoping, JavaScript has global and local scopes. Variables declared outside of a function have global scope, which means they're available everywhere in your code. However, if you define a variable inside a function, it becomes local to that function and cannot be used outside of it. Variables can also be scoped inside if conditions or blocks unless you use the var keyword, which hoists the variable up into the local scope for that function.<br />

## Functions
Functions are one of the main building blocks in JavaScript. They work by taking an input or argument, then optionally returning a value that can be used somewhere else. **Functions are just objects**, which means they can also be used as expressions, allowing them to be used as variables or to construct higher-order functions where a function is used as an argument or a return value.
```
function add(a,b){
    return a+b;
}

const add = function(a,b){
    return a+b;
}

function higherOrder(fun) {
    fun();
    return function(){

    }
}
```

Functions can also be nested to create a closure that encapsulates data and logic from the rest of the program. Normally, when you call a function that has a variable with a primitive value, **it's stored on the call stack, which is the browser's short-term memory.** **However, when you create a closure**, the inner function can still access variables in the outer function even after the initial function call. That's because JavaScript automatically stores the data in the outer function in the **Heap memory**, which persists between function calls.
```
function giveMeClosure(){
    let a = 10;
    return function () {
        a++;
        return a;
    }
}

```

## Closures
Now let's talk about closures. A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function, and the inner function has access to the outer function's variables. The inner function "closes over" the outer function's variables and retains access to them even after the outer function has completed execution.

```
function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  }
}

let counter = makeCounter();
counter(); // Output: 1
counter(); // Output: 2
```
In this example, makeCounter creates a closure by returning a function that has access to the count variable. When we call makeCounter, it initializes count to 0 and returns a function that increments count and logs its value to the console. We then assign this returned function to the counter variable, which becomes a closure that has access to count. When we call counter, it increments and logs the value of count. Since counter is a closure, it retains access to count and can continue to increment it each time it's called. <br />

## This Keyword
Finally, I want to briefly touch on the this keyword. this is a special keyword in JavaScript that references an object.<br />

Firstly, let's discuss arrow functions. Arrow functions do not have their own this value and they are always anonymous, which makes them ideal for function expressions. This means that when you use an arrow function, it does not create a new this value but instead inherits it from its parent scope. This can be useful in certain situations, and it makes arrow functions quite powerful.

``` 
function wtIsThis(){
    console.log(this)
}

function person = {
    wtIsThis: ()=>{
        console.log(this);
    }
}
```
## Function Arguments
Moving on to function arguments, it's important to note that when passing arguments, a primitive value like a number is passed by value. This means that a copy is created of the original variable. However, if the argument is an object, it's stored in the Heap and it's passed by reference. This means that multiple parts of the code might be mutating the same object. It's important to keep this in mind when working with objects in JavaScript.<br />
```
const num = 23;
const obj = new Object();

someFun(num, obj);
```

## Objects

Speaking of which, let's dive into objects. The easiest way to define an object is with the object literal syntax using braces. An object contains a collection of properties, each of which has a name and a value. These values can be anything from primitive data types to other objects or even functions.

### Object Literal
In JavaScript, an object literal is a way to define an object using a set of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces. Here's an example of an object literal:

```
const human = {
    dna: 'AACTG',
    name: 'Jeff',
    born: Date.now(),
    walk(){
        console.log('walking)
    }
}
```
In this example, person is an object that has four properties: name, age, gender, and occupation. Each property has a corresponding value that can be accessed or modified using dot notation or square bracket notation, like this:

console.log(person.name); // output: "John"
person.age = 31;
console.log(person.age); // output: 31




Objects can inherit properties from each other, thanks to a mechanism called the prototype chain. Every object in JavaScript has a private property that links to exactly one prototype. This differs from class-based inheritance found in many other languages because we're dealing with real objects that take up memory, as opposed to abstract classes in your traditional class-based language.

The prototype chain is essentially a chain of objects, where each object in the chain is linked to its parent object via its prototype property. When you try to access a property on an object, JavaScript first looks for that property on the object itself. If it's not found, it follows the prototype chain upwards until it finds the property or reaches the end of the chain (which is usually the Object.prototype).

This mechanism of inheritance can be quite powerful, as it allows you to create complex object structures that are easy to manage and maintain. However, it's important to use it judiciously, as it can also lead to performance issues if not implemented correctly.

## Prototype Chain
JavaScript also has objects, which can contain a collection of key-value pairs or properties and values. Objects can inherit properties from each other thanks to a mechanism called the prototype chain. JavaScript supports object-oriented programming with the class keyword, which is just syntactic sugar for prototypal inheritance and objects.<br />
```


```
## Data Structure
JavaScript has several built-in data structures, including arrays, sets, and maps. Arrays are used to hold a dynamic collection of indexed items, while sets hold a collection of unique items. Maps are like objects but can be more easily looped over and contain a key-value pair.<br />

## Event Loop
Finally, JavaScript has an interesting feature called the event loop, which allows you to write asynchronous code that runs in a separate thread pool while the rest of the application continues to execute. This is important because modern websites often have multiple things going on at the same time, but they only have access to a single thread for computing called the main thread. Asynchronous code is executed in the background, and its results are later returned to the main thread.<br />

```setTimeOut()```
A promise is an essential concept in JavaScript that provides a way to handle asynchronous operations. In simple terms, a promise is a wrapper for a value that is currently unknown but will resolve to a value in the future. For instance, a promise can be used to make a call to a third-party API that will eventually return some data. If something goes wrong in this process, the promise can reject and raise an error.

To handle these two possible outcomes, the consumer of the promise can use methods like then() and catch(). Alternatively, an async function can be defined to automatically return a promise. The body of the function can then use the await keyword to pause its execution and wait for other promises to resolve. This results in readable code that is easier to understand.

However, as the codebase grows in complexity, it becomes challenging to maintain all the code in a single file. This is where modules come in handy. In JavaScript, a module is a file that contains code that can be shared between different files. By default, all the code in a module is private to that file. Still, it's possible to make some code available to other files by exporting it as a default export or a named export.

A default export is a way of exporting a single value from a module. It can be a function or an object, among other things. To use a default export in another file, an import statement can be used. On the other hand, named exports are used to export multiple values from a module.
