## How to combine two objects or arrays
The two object here share the property of 'third', 
**Goal:** Combine two object into a new object 
```
const obj1 = {
    first: 'a',
    second: 'b',
    third: 'c',
}

const obj2={
    third:'d',
    fourth:'e',
    ...obj1,
}

```const full = Object.assign({},obj1,obj2)```

**Introducing Spread Operator**
We start with an object literal
const full = {...obj1, ...obj2};
